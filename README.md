# Krylov FRI Tools

*We present proof of concept code -- MATLAB and Python -- for
identification of the union of subspaces in FRI estimation problems when the
number of measurements greatly exceeds the dimension of the model. This
scenario happens frequently in wireless communications,* eg. *OFDM channels
estimation from pilots. The key properties are a superlinear running-time and
a linear memory consumption in term of the input size.*
